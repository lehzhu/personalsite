I maintain a few [open source projects](https://github.com/milesmcc), and I want to be accessible and responsive to everyone who uses my software. Sometimes it's hard to coordinate projects or debug issues via GitHub or email â€” synchronous communication is often just _better_. Sometimes it's just nice to see each others' faces. That's why I host office hours.
