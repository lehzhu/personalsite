I led a Data and QA engineering project at [JD Power](https://www.jdpower.com/business) in the [Power Information Network](https://www.jdpower.com/business/pin-automotive-products) team.

My role involved creating and managing new QA processes to supervise the migration from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/cloud/) to newer in-house cloud solutions. Apache Spark, Kubernetes, Google BigQuery, Cucumber, Playwright

I was nominated for intern of the year for both years that I was there.
