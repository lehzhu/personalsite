I led a QA engineering project at JD Power in the Power Information Network team. 

JD Power is an analytics firm that started out giving car awards, but is now responsible for the data stack in a multitude of industries. The Power Information Network is the primary offering for the North American car dealership industry, consolidating data from most leading vendors. 

My role involved creating and managing new QA processes to supervise the migration from Oracle to newer in-house cloud solutions. 

I was nominated for intern of the year for both years that I was an intern.
