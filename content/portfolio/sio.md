Since October 2020, I've worked at the [Stanford Internet Observatory](https://io.stanford.edu) (SIO) as a technical research assistant. I've worked on a combination of technical infrastructure, research projects, and investigations.

* My research and investigatory work was quoted in Time Magazine, featured in VICE, and cited by the New York Times.
* I built high-volume data ingest and analysis systems processing 250M+ events per day.
* I implemented real-time media analysis pipelines with PDQ perceptual hashing, PhotoDNA integration, and asymmetric cryptography for CSAM reporting.
* I reverse engineered Gettr (a far-right alt-network) to build GoGettr, a comprehensive Python library to archive and monitor the platform, and built analogous tools for Gab and Dissenter.
