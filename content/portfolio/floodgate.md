I was part of [Floodgate](https://floodgate.com)'s Reactor program. With my good friend [Rhythm](https://rhythmgarg.com), I co-created:

* An AI meeting notes app called [Paxo](https://paxo.ai) that we grew to $20k in ARR. We didn't spend any money on advertising — all our growth was original. We sold the business.
* A "semantic observability" tool called Watchpost to give businesses a way to monitor the quality of their generative AI model outputs.
* An end-to-end encrypted location sharing app for family safety called [Latitude](https://heylatitude.com).
