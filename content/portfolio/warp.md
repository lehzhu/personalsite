I am currently the Campus Lead for [Warp](https://warp.dev) at Western University. 

Warp is an AI-first reimagination of the Terminal, and something I use every single day. As part of the Campus program, I work to understand users and the product, as well as ideate and execute on long term projects that improve the developer experience.
