I want to start asking two questions to gauge my feelings on something: am I working on something useful and rewarding, and am I doing it with people who I love and who love me back? 

I didn't use to care about this. Perhaps it's because not a lot of things made by teens are useful in the real world, and I wasn't good at giving love to people in a conventional, North American fashion. 

I've made large strides in both areas, but it feels inopportune to focus on them now. We are constantly surrounded by greating social and economic reminders that try to strip us from pre-existing values, which is sometimes useful but often confusing.
