Canadian operating culture and entrepreneurial culture has long been described as different. I have long had some reservations about the cultural environments, especially with regard to the incubation phases. 

Entrepreneurship is about taking risks. You are literally rewarded for your risk, and in a purely academic context you are rewarded for nothing else. Any property or labour you invest in the endeavour is categorized as rent and wages (again, academically), while profit is reserved for risk. 

The first mistake that we make with many young Canadians is that we don't drill this into their heads. The overwhelming exercise we give is for them to think of a problem they experience, and try to solve it. Problem-solving is good, and getting a good grasp on problem-identification is also useful. However, there is a profound lack of bet-making. 

*Startups are bets on the future*, an outsized wager on a particular outcome. While mathematically similar to gambling, the key difference is that the Expected Value is always supposed to be positive. Paul Graham's [recent criticism](https://x.com/paulg/status/1885003032460476671) of a popular HackerNews post has reintroduced this to my context window ([screenshot backup]{.hover-image data-image="/images/pghn.png"}).
