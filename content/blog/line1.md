Every time I step on line 1 after travelling abroad, I feel something different.

Has to be abroad. Montreal and Vancouver feel too close. Has to be line 1. 

I think I started solo travelling either earlier and later than most people, depending on your definition. If you count unaccompanied minor programs, I was 4 when I took my first solo flight from Hefei to Chengdu to spend the summer with my grandparents. It was the only way I was going to see them, as everyone was either busy or couldn't make a flight to pick me up. I felt a bit scared.

I had a few more solo flights thereafter, mostly from Toronto to Shanghai. I probably made that round trip about 7 times now.

So when I came back after going to New York in 2023, it was interesting. I felt that I was finally growing up. I was finally able to do things on my own. I was finally able to make my own decisions. I was finally able to take care of myself.`
