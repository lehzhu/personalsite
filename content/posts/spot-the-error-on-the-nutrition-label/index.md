I usually only write about my own mistakes, but here I'm going to be writing about a mistake I noticed an error on the nutrition label of Quaker Oatmeal Squares cereal. The error is extremely minor (at least as far as I can tell), but it made me thinkâ€”this label has been printed and seen probably millions of times, and yet this error remains on the box to this day (as of mid-August 2020).

I've included a photo of the label below. Can you see the error (or, really, inconsistency)?

Don't see it? Compare the percent daily value (% DV) for protein across the "cereal alone" and "with 1/2 cup of milk" categories. The cereal alone has 6 grams of protein, corresponding to 7% DV; the cereal with half a cup of milk has 10 grams of protein, corresponding to 16% DV.

Maybe I misunderstand nutrition labels, but surely both of these can't be correct. If 6 grams is 7% of the daily recommended amount of protein, then the total recommended amount of protein would be `6/x = 7/100 -> 7x = 600 -> 600/7 = x` 86 grams of protein. If 10 grams is 16% the daily recommended amount of protein, then the total recommended amount would be `10/x = 16/100 -> 1000 = 16x -> 1000/16 = x` 63 grams of protein.

As far as I know, the daily recommended amount of protein used for these nutrition labels can't be simultaneously 63 grams and 86 grams? There must be an error somewhere.

> If you're wondering how I found this error, it's because the front of the box advertises 10g of protein per serving. This seemed high for a cereal, so I looked at the protein section of the nutrition label, which is where I spotted this.
