I'm passionate about social computing. I'm working on products that move the needle for a more equitable and productive future, and I want to help others do it at scale.

### Currently

- Completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Western University.
- Working on [FileSeek](/portfolio/fileseek), a supercharged Finder. 
- Building effective incentive structures with social alignment 
- Mentoring the next generation of engineering leaders as part of [Western AI](/portfolio/wai) and the [Warp](/portfolio/warp) Campus Lead program.

### Previously

- I led a Data & QA Engineering team at [JD Power](/portfolio/jdpower), transforming the largest automotive analytics product in the world.
- I worked on data science and analytics [projects](/portfolio/pangea) for non-profits throughout North America.

### Broadly

I'm interested in aligning humans to do more net good through novel theses in social computing. Curiosity is my strong suit, and I leverage this alongside my ability to see and analyze connections through multiple layers of the world.

I enjoy writing [essays](/blog), both long-form and short-form. Writing is a process that forces us to defend and challenge our assumptions, knowledge, and beliefs, and I love that process.
