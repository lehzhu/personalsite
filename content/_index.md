I'm passionate about analytics, B2B innovation, and social computing.

### Currently

- I'm completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Western University.
- I'm working on [FileSeek](/portfolio/fileseek), a local document understanding tool.
- Director on [Project Regen](/portfolio/regen) and [Western AI](portfolio/wai) Educations. 

### Previously

- I led a Data & QA Engineering team at [JD Power](/portfolio/jdpower), transforming the largest automotive analytics product in the world.
- I worked on data science and analytics [projects](/portfolio/pangea) for non-profits throughout North America.

### Broadly

I'm interested in aligning humans to do more net good through novel theses in social computing. Curiosity is my strong suit, and I leverage this alongside my ability to see and analyze connections through multiple layers of the world.

I enjoy writing [essays](/blog), both long-form and short-form. Writing is a process that forces us to defend and challenge our assumptions, knowledge, and beliefs, and I love that process.

Check out my [portfolio](/portfolio) for more about my work.
